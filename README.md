#ðŸ’¡ Q) **Does GitHub pages support custom domain names? for eg. if I want to host my website on [nchaudhari.com](http://nchaudhari.com) instead of [ninadpchaudhari.github.io](http://ninadpchaudhari.github.io) ? If yes, Specify the link to appropriate documentation. If no, suggest some workarounds.**

YES, you can set up a custom domain:

To set up a custom domain on GitHub Pages, you need to follow these general steps:

Purchase a domain name: If you haven't already, you'll need to purchase a domain name from a domain registrar like GoDaddy, Namecheap, or Google Domains.

Configure DNS settings: Log in to your domain registrar's website and navigate to the DNS settings or DNS management section. Add or modify DNS records to point your domain to GitHub's servers. GitHub provides specific IP addresses and DNS records that you need to configure. You can find these details in GitHub's documentation.

Configure GitHub Pages settings: In your GitHub repository settings, under the "GitHub Pages" section, you'll find an option to add a custom domain. Enter your custom domain name (e.g., nchaudhari.com) and save the changes.

Verify domain configuration: After configuring DNS settings and GitHub Pages settings, it may take some time for the changes to propagate across the internet. You can use online DNS lookup tools to verify that your domain is correctly pointing to GitHub's servers.
